# EnergyExtraction
This repo contains codes for the "Active Energy Extraction" paper.

In af_trans_*.py an activation front moves and provide new active matter which results in sustained transport of the particle. 

In active_string.py the energy conservation and First law of thermodynamics is investigated for an isolated active string which undergoes contraction induced by the active stress.

In active_nx.py the particle is removed, i.e. only the dynamics of active region is simulated. That is sufficient so long as the effect of the particle on the field is neglected.
